*Productivity website, and also my final project for cs50web*

## Idea and Functions

This is a productivity website for taking notes, making day schedule, and setting goals. 

## Distinctiveness and Complexity

This web application is not a social media platform, nither an e-commerce, it is a productivity website, as I mentioned earlier. Currently my webapp has 8 models in my backend, and I tried my best to make the design responsive for mobile devices using tailwind css. 

Speaking about complexity, I decided to use javascript React framework for frontend here, so I can advance my learning skills and become familiar with one of the most popuar technologies of the web development.

However, with using React as my frontend came significant challenges. One of the most important questions I had to answer and quite a difficult problem to be solved was, how to pair React frontend with Django Backend. I decided to put my frontend folder inside my main project folder with api manage.py file, and by editing my settings.py, serve the index.html from frontend build as a tamplate and my bundled js and css code as static files.
